# 10/15, 2017, Logistic regression and NN
Coursera Week 4 Programming Assignment: 
 1. Build up a multi-class classifier using logistic regression: 
    Input: hand-writting number images of 20X20 pixel grayscale images; 
    Ouput: numbers; 
 2. Build up a hand-writting number classifier using pre-determined NN. 
    Input: hand-writting number images of 20X20 pixel grayscale images; 
    Hidden layer: 1; 
    Output: numbers; 

# 10/20, 2017, Neural Network
Coursera Week 5 Programming Assignment Initialization: 
  1. Buildup forward propagation for NN to calculate cost function; 
  2. Buildup backward propagation for NN to calculate model gradient; 
  3. Sigmoid function and its derivative function; 
  4. Buildup regularization for model; 
  5. #TODO#: vetorization for building-up cost and gradient (model trainning); 
  6. #TODO#: impelementation of multi-layer NN instead of hard coding for 1 hidden layer. 

# 10/22, 2017, Facilities for Applying ML
Coursera Week 6, exercise V assignment initialization: 
  1. Buildup linear regression solution; 
  2. Buildup polymerization funtion for polymerization features; 
  3. Studyed how the regularization coefficient effects the ML system; 
  4. #TODO#: Randomization of the sample select. 

# 10/29, 2017, Developing a Support Vector Machine
Coursera Week 7, exercise VI finished: 
  1. BUild up Gaussian Kernel for Support Vector Machine; 
  2. Parameters optimization (e.g. regularization and gaussian kernel coefficient lambda) over validation set; 
  3. Email context extraction; 
  4. Email feature generate (from spam dictionary); 

# 11/01. 2017, Clustering and Principle Componet Analysis
  1. Homework initialized
  2. #TODO# review the runKMeans.m function to see how the ploting function works;
